# uduzgak naming research (previous working name: Yönlek)

This file is the repository's canonical naming and brand-research record. It
keeps the active naming decision, technical slug, compatibility constraints, and
unresolved clearance work in one tracked place.

Status: preliminary collision research only. This is not trademark clearance or
legal advice.

## Current naming state

**uduzgak** is the active working product name. The collision screening below
was performed for the previous name **Yönlek** and must not be interpreted as
trademark or availability research for uduzgak.

The npm package and product-facing slug use `uduzgak`. The GitHub repository
name and local working folder remain `yonlek` pending a separately verified
rename. The current implementation uses the new name for:

- the npm package name;
- product-facing application metadata and headings.

The two browser persistence keys remain:

```text
workspace-app.workspace
workspace-app.view-preferences
```

Those identifiers predate the Yönlek name. They are kept so existing browser
data remains discoverable. A future rename of the keys needs a tested data
migration.

Using uduzgak in product code does not mean the new name has passed formal
trademark clearance. No collision search for the new name is recorded here.

## Historical research: why Yönlek was selected previously

The preliminary search favored Yönlek because:

- it is short;
- it is easy to pronounce in Turkish;
- it is built around the familiar Turkish root `yön`;
- it is visually and phonetically distinct from ClickUp;
- broad exact-name web searches for `Yönlek` and `Yonlek` did not reveal an
  obvious active software product, app, or company using the exact name at the
  time of the research;
- the surfaced exact-name results were unrelated linguistic, historical, OCR,
  or geographic references.

This is only collision screening. Ordinary web search cannot establish
trademark availability.

## Rejected Turkish candidates

### Görevce

Rejected because an active Google Play application named `Görevce` was found.

### İşlek

Rejected because `işlek` was already used by an active Turkish software product
whose site stated that the `işlek®` mark was registered in Class 42.

### Dizge

Rejected because `Dizge` was already used by active Turkish software and app
products.

### Düzence

Not preferred because it is an existing Turkish dictionary word meaning
discipline. That makes it more descriptive and less distinctive as a software
mark.

## Search variants used in the preliminary review

The working-name review included:

- `Yönlek`
- `Yonlek`
- `Yönlek software`
- `Yonlek software`
- `Yönlek app`
- `Yonlek app`
- `Yönlek şirket`
- `Yonlek company`
- `Yönlek trademark`
- `Yonlek trademark`
- site-scoped searches against TÜRKPATENT-indexed pages and common software
  platforms

No obvious exact-name software, app, or company collision appeared in those
ordinary searches. That result should be treated as a reason to continue the
clearance process, not as proof that the mark is available.

## Formal clearance still required

Before a public launch or significant branding spend, review at least:

- [ ] TÜRKPATENT Marka Araştırma
- [ ] WIPO Global Brand Database
- [ ] EUIPO or TMview
- [ ] USPTO if the United States becomes a launch market
- [ ] Turkish company and trade-name records
- [ ] relevant domain names
- [ ] Apple App Store and Google Play
- [ ] npm, GitHub, and major software directories
- [ ] phonetic, visual, and semantic near matches

Likely Nice classes to review with a trademark professional include:

- Class 9 for downloadable or recorded software;
- Class 42 for SaaS, PaaS, and software services.

The exact filing strategy depends on the final product and launch markets.

## Working-name rule

Until formal clearance is complete:

- use **uduzgak** as the working product name and npm package slug;
- retain `yonlek` for the existing GitHub remote and checkout until their
  separately coordinated rename;
- do not describe the name as registered, cleared, or protected unless that is
  formally established;
- do not rename established browser storage keys without a migration;
- rerun collision searches before public launch because name availability can
  change over time.

## Documentation rule

`BRAND_NAME_RESEARCH.md` is the canonical naming and brand-research record. Do
not create a second naming document with overlapping conclusions. Update this
file so repository guidance has one source of truth.
